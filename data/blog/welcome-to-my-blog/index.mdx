# Welcome to my first blog post!

Hello, my name is Tiago, and I'm IT student that is hungry for learning about
web development, cybersecurity or anything new and exciting on technology. In
this Blog I want to talk about the things that I learned and things that I enjoy
doing in my free time like, building *unnecessary/cool* stuff and contributing
to open source.

## Tools

One day decided to install a linux distribution on my notebook, I was tired of
using **Windows** and all that crap about using a system that you need to buy,
to be honest that time I didn't know anything about all telemetry that
**Microsoft** gave me with no choice. So I took a decision, let's install a
Linux distribution but, which one? I ask my brother, and he said to me that an
easy way in could be **Ubuntu**, a friendly distribution. 

I didn't know that my curiosity, and the need to use the terminal on Ubuntu
would give rise to a new big passion.

What I used:
1. Ubuntu
    - gnome
    - bspwm
    - gnome(back..., haha)
2. Pop! OS
    - Cosmic
3. Arch Linux(current)
    - Hyprland (very beautiful, but buggy)
    - i3-wm (simple, straightforward and lightweight)

*I'll talk about all this path in the future!*

## Web development

When I started studding programming, the first language that I spent real time
learning was **Javascript** and I decided to specialize in web development, and
throughout this process I learned about some front-end tools like React, Angular
and Astro. On the server side I build some application with Expressjs and
Fastify.

I'm currently learning Java with Springboot and in the future I pretend to learn
Go.

_I'll also talk about what I'm learning and some specific web stuff_
